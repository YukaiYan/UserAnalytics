# Week \#

## Team Report

### Last week's goals
- Make the backend detect when Chrome is in focus or minimized
- Clearly define data storage and make sure middleware functions align
- Create the data processing layer
- Hook up the frontend to mock data
- Increase the number of CI and UI tests

### Progress and issues
No major issues this week. Our team redesigned and reimplemented our backend schema. We then also integrated the front end with the backend through a data processing layer.

### Plans for next week
- Polish frontend UI
- Make tests for all of the core functionality of the project
- Implement user category configuration, blacklisting, and turning on and off tracking

### Agenda
- Talk about the upcoming assignment
