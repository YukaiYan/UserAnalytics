# Week 8#

## Team Report

### Last week's goals
- Integrate tracking toggle into frontend
- Further clean up frontend UI
- Implement website favicons into frontend UI
- Add UI Tests and more middleware tests

### Progress and issues
Fetching icons took a bit of research since not every websites keep their favicons in the same way. Additionally testing has proven to be trickier than we expected. Since a lot of our frontend is created using JavaScript, full UI testing is infeasible.

### Plans for next week
- Allow users to view/change cateogires in settings
- Don't track special website, chrome://*, UA Dashboard, newtab, and debug behavior
- Delete data in backend that is older thatn 7 days
- Make the Chrome-mimicking api merge object states
- Finalize and clean up code/repo

### Agenda
- Talk about the upcoming assignment
