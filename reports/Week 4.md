# Week 4#

## Team Report

### Last week's goals
Create a chrome extension that stores a piece of data in an S3 bucket.

### Progress and issues
Our team created different indvidual extension testing different key parts of our final product. We also created digital mockups for the UI.
One issue is that react is too heavyweight and does not play well with Chrome extensions, so we've decided to use vanilla html/css/js.

### Plans for next week
- Explore Tailwind for vanilla html/css styling
- Figure out how to display graphs
- Team should play with digital prototype and provide feedback
- Iterate on mockup design, finalize by this week
- Plan/start the backend, figure out how and where to store data
