# Week #

## Team Report

### Last week's goals
- Explore Tailwind for vanilla html/css styling
- Figure out how to display graphs
- Team should play with digital prototype and provide feedback
- Iterate on mockup design, finalize by this week
- Plan/start the backend, figure out how and where to store data

### Progress and issues
Frontend and backend are both being implemented, found a usable graphing framework. 
No major issues, just small ones we debugged.

### Plans for next week
- Create unit tests that work in chrome for our existing extension
- Finish implementing a mock frontend ui
- Finish backend/middleware functions, write to Chrome local storage

### Agenda
- Talk about the upcoming assignment
