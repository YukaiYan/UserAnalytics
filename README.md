# UserAnalytics

UserAnalytics is a chrome extension which tracks how much time a user spends on different websites and presents that data to the user in various pleasingly data visualizations.

## Goals
UserAnalytics has 4 main features that we aim to develop in 8 weeks.
1. User can visualize usage for each domain with a running average
2. User can visualize usage for each day of the week in hours with a running average
3. User can configure white/blacklist for which domain tracking
4. Extension categories time spent automatically (social media, reading/reference, and productivity)

There are additional strech goals as well.
- Focus/Relax mode that can be suggested on/off based on user actions (ML) or manually turned on
- User can work with more advanced data visualizations for specific websites
- Block sites at certain times, set time limits for certain sites
